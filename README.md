# goset

One would argue that implementing set in go is easy. Thus, a library for a set is unnecessary. I agree, but if you have
to implement it over and over again for many projects, it becomes tedious. So, I wrote a simple library, hoping it would
save me a few lines in my projects.

As any other go library, you can install it by
```shell
go get githuh.com/suyono3484/goset
```
